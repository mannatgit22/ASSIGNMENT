          <p><br>There were tears and hugs all-around at the Kensington Oval, in Bridgetown, Barbados, after India won the Twenty20 World Cup on Saturday, beating South Africa by seven runs in the final and ending a 11-year wait for a global title.

            Relief was written large on the faces of most of the Indian players who were in tears after the match, which was a fitting finale for three stalwarts of the team.Virat Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma announced their retirements from T20 Internationals after the match while Head Coach Rahul Dravid held the trophy and screamed in a rare show of emotion at the end of his spell in charge of the national side.<br><br></p>

        <p><br>Rohit, who played a crucial role in India's triumphant campaign, confirmed that he would continue to represent India in ODIs and Tests.
          "This was my last (T20I) game as well," Rohit revealed during the post-match press conference. "No better time to say goodbye to this format. I've loved every moment of this. I started my India career playing this format. This is what I wanted, I wanted to win the cup. I wanted this badly. Very hard to put in words. It was a very emotional moment for me. I was very desperate for this title in my life. Happy that we eventually crossed the line."<br><br></p>
